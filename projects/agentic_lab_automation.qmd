## Problem

Automating scientific workflows requires systems that can plan experiments, interpret results, and adapt strategies based on outcomes. Traditional scripting is too rigid for exploratory research.

## Approach

I am building agentic AI systems that combine reinforcement learning with large language models to automate laboratory tasks. The system plans multi-step experiments, executes protocols on robotic platforms, and iteratively refines hypotheses based on results.

## Status

Work in progress. Focusing on safety checks, tool reliability, and experiment bookkeeping for CMU Cloud Lab.
