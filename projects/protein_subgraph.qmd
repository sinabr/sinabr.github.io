## Problem

Foundation models like ESM-2 provide powerful protein embeddings but do not include enough structural information and evolutionary signals that are critical for function prediction.

## Approach

We developed graph-based protein representations using structural subgraph counts combined with evolutionary features. The method constructs protein graphs from structures and extracts interpretable features that capture local geometry and conservation patterns.

## Results

Outperforms ESM-2 embeddings and GNN-based models on pathogenicity prediction tasks. Provides interpretable features that domain experts can analyze.

## Status

Manuscript in preparation. Code includes baseline comparisons and evaluation protocols. Code and data will be released.
