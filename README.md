# Quarto Personal Site

This is a Quarto website optimized for long-term maintenance. Edit the `.qmd` files in the root and in the `projects/`, `publications/`, and `posts/` folders. Render locally with `quarto preview`. Deploy automatically with GitHub Actions when you push to `main`.

## Quick start
1) Install Quarto: https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/
2) Replace `YOUR_USERNAME`, `YOUR_EMAIL`, and social links in `_quarto.yml` and `contact.qmd`.
3) Commit and push to a repository named `YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`.
4) Enable GitHub Pages to serve from the `gh-pages` branch created by the workflow.

Content to edit first: `index.qmd`, `about.qmd`, `research.qmd`, `projects/`, `publications/`, and `files/Sina_Barazandeh_CV.pdf`.
