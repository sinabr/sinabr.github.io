<!-- This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io). -->


About me
======

I'm a M.Sc. Computer Science student at [CicekLab](http://ciceklab.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/), Bilkent University. I work on the application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology. My research interests include ML/DL, Computational Biology, Bioinformatics, and Biomedical Engineering.

In CicekLab, we work on various problems including Generative Models, Sequence Optimization, and Variant Calling as well as Single Cell Genomics. My research has been focused Generative Models and sequence optimization, we worked on generating and optimizing 5' UTR sequences for higher mRNA and Protein expression, and piRNA sequences for targeting proteins. We currently work on Protein sequence design and optimization using various methods including transformers. 

I finished my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering in 2021 from Shiraz University, Iran. I worked on recommendation systems in my B.Sc. thesis under supervision of Dr. Reza Boostani. I was a member of the Interdisciplinary Robotics Association of Shiraz University and the VP of the Association for 2 years. I and my team (Namira) participated in IranOpen and International Robocup Competitions in Tehran and Montreal (Remotely).
