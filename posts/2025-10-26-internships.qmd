I am looking for Summer 2026 internships in biotech and tech companies. My research spans generative models for biological sequences, protein representation learning, and biomarker discovery using machine learning.

I am particularly interested in roles involving:

- ML for drug discovery and protein design
- Foundation models for biology
- Computational methods for single-cell analysis
- AI systems for laboratory automation
- Sequence optimization and generative modeling

I have experience building production-ready PyTorch code, running large-scale experiments on HPC clusters, and publishing in top venues. I value reproducible research, strong baselines, and clear communication.

If your team works at the intersection of machine learning and biology, I would be happy to connect.
