My research applies machine learning to biological problems, with focus on three main areas:

## Generative Models for Biological Sequences

I design generative models for DNA, RNA, and protein sequences with controllable properties. This includes GANs for 5' UTR optimization, transformer-based seq2seq models for protein-conditional RNA design, and methods that balance biological validity with desired functional properties. My work emphasizes reproducible baselines and validation against held-out predictive models.

## Protein Representation Learning

I develop graph-based methods for protein representation that incorporate structural and evolutionary information. Current work focuses on subgraph-based features that outperform foundation model embeddings on downstream tasks like pathogenicity prediction. I aim to build representations that are both accurate and interpretable for domain experts.

## Biomarker Discovery and Single-Cell Analysis

I apply reinforcement learning to identify minimal gene panels that distinguish cellular states, particularly for senescence biomarkers. This involves positive-unlabeled learning objectives, structure-aware rewards, and robust evaluation protocols. The goal is to find parsimonious biomarker sets that generalize across datasets and experimental conditions.

## Additional Interests

I am also exploring agentic AI systems for laboratory automation, combining reinforcement learning with large language models to plan and execute experimental workflows autonomously.

All projects emphasize reproducible code, strong baselines, and clear communication of methods and limitations.
