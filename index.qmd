I am a PhD student in the **School of Computer Science** at **Carnegie Mellon University**, in the **Computational Biology Department**, advised by **Dr. Jose Lugo-Martinez**.

I build machine learning methods for biology and medicine, with focus on **generative models for biological sequences**, **protein representation learning**, and **biomarker discovery**. My work spans foundation models, reinforcement learning, and graph-based approaches.

I am seeking **Summer 2026 internships** in biotech and tech, where I can apply my expertise in ML for biology, sequence design, and computational drug discovery.

::: {.callout-note}
I value **robust baselines**, **reproducible code**, and **clear methods** that can be understood by both ML researchers and domain scientists.

## Research Highlights

- **Generative AI for Biology:** Sequence design using GANs, LLMs, and seq2seq models for optimizing translation efficiency and RNA targeting
- **Reinforcement Learning for Biomarker Discovery:** Policy optimization for identifying senescence biomarkers with structure-aware rewards
- **Graph-Based Protein Representation:** Evolution-informed subgraph features that outperform foundation model embeddings on downstream tasks
- **Laboratory Automation:** Building agentic AI systems using RL and LLMs for autonomous experimental workflows

## Recent News

- Two publications in 2025: PLOS Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Advances
- Attending SenNet Annual Meeting (Washington DC, 2025) and PathVisions (San Diego, 2025)
- Now seeking Summer 2026 internships
